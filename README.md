Who needs a name anyway??

 

This is a ever evolving light kitchen sink pack with progression starting in 1.10.2. 

 

There is a youtube series to go along with this ever evolving progression pack.

 

1.0 Will be the initial version of mods and basic configs and then from here on out it will be finely tuned and progression added to the pack to make it more long term goal driven then anything else that i have done before.

 

So please download and come onlong for the ride and help this pack grow.
